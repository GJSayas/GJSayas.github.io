The beauty of computer programming is that you do not need to formally go to school to learn how to program. You can learn almost everything that you would need to know online, and for free. The following resources are some that I have used personally, that I highly recommend, for anyone looking to learn more about computer programming.

## [Trusted Scientific Publications: Nature Biomedical Engineering](https://www.nature.com/natbiomedeng/)

My personal favourite research source on up to date papers focused on Biomedical Engineering. Other sites I use for finding trust worthy scientific papers, non spicific ofon BME topics are: 
#### [IEEE Xplore Digital Library](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp)
#### [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/)
#### [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/)
#### [National Library of Medicine](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)

## [Magazines and Newsletters Archives of EMBS](https://www.embs.org/resources/)

Being a member of the Institute of Electric and Electronic Engineers, and a Biomedical Engineering Student, I have been a member of the EMBS Society (Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society) for all of my academic career. This platform has allow me to gain access to many magazines and other learning resources that provide new information of Biomedical Engineering Developments all around the world.
##### Some of the actualization resources I like include: 
  1. IEEE EMBS Pulse [Magazine](https://www.embs.org/pulse/) and [Podcast](https://www.embs.org/pulse/media/podcasts/)
  2. [IEEE NanoBioscience](https://www.ieee.org/membership-catalog/productdetail/showProductDetailPage.html?product=PER191-ELE)
  3. [IEEE Molecular, Biological, and Multi-Scale Communications](https://www.ieee.org/membership-catalog/productdetail/showProductDetailPage.html?product=PER475-ELE&searchResults=Y)
  4. [IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10328862)
  5. [IEEE EMBS Newsletter](https://www.embs.org/newsletter/archives/)


## [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) & [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayo.edu/research)

A great resource not only for learning many STEM disciplines (what most people probably know Khan Academy for), but also [computer programming](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming). What Khan Academy offers that is different from the other two above resources is that it offers courses in [computer science related](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science) topics.  

In more medically releated topic, another source for learning and gaining information is the Mayo Clinic's [website](https://www.mayoclinic.org/), which I mainly use to gain information on how medical procedures are done on their [Test Procedures Archives](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures) and to see what scientific developments are taking place at [Mayo Clinic Research](https://www.mayo.edu/research). Also, they have a very interesting subdivision called the [College of Medicine and Sciente](https://college.mayo.edu/) where people can enroll in their programs.
